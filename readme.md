This repository contains the MPLAB® Harmony 3 Motor Control module.  This module
contains motor control demonstrations implemented on Microchip's 32-bit SAM
microcontrollers. Users can use these demonstrations as a reference for
developing their own motor control applications on Microchip's SAM series of
microcontrollers using MPLAB Harmony 3. Refer to he following links for release
notes and licensing information.
